                                    <h4>FROM SLUMS TO MANHOLES: THE LIFE OF A SANITARY WORKER IN PAKISTAN</h4>
                                </div>

                                    <div class="news-block-body">
                                        <p><strong>The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan</strong> is a living document that aims to enshrine
                                            important fundamental human rights in Chapter 1. However, the implementation of Chapter 1
                                            has tragically failed with respect to sanitation workers, primarily due to governmental
                                            negligence and the courts' inability to effectively uphold these rights. There is a notable absence
                                            of a legal framework or government policies designed to provide and safeguard the rights of
                                            sanitary workers in Pakistan. Furthermore, the development of jurisprudence ensuring their
                                            rights has been minimal, rendering Article 184(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of
                                            Pakistan a mere dead letter for sanitation workers. This article aims to delve into the ways in
                                            which specific constitutional rights of sanitary workers have been curtailed, ultimately leading to
                                            certain conclusions. </p>

                                        <p><strong>The report</strong> published by the National Commission for Human Rights has made it abundantly
                                            clear that the majority of individuals undertaking sanitation jobs in our country belong to
                                            minority groups. This raises the question: Why do minorities constitute the largest portion of
                                            sanitation workers in Pakistan? The answer lies in the lack of access to quality education
                                            guaranteed under Article 25A of the Constitution. This deficiency in education opportunities
                                            leads to a scarcity of alternative job prospects, thereby leaving sanitation-related positions as
                                            one of the few available options.</p>
                                            
                                        <p><strong>According to Article 25A of the constitution,</strong> it becomes the responsibility of the incumbent
                                            government to ensure the education of all citizens of Pakistan between the ages of five and
                                            sixteen. Regrettably, the literacy rate among minorities in Pakistan has remained distressingly
                                            low for centuries, resulting in thousands being unable to attend schools and colleges. In such
                                            circumstances, many are compelled to take up sanitation jobs to financially support their
                                            households during periods of economic recession. Consequently, this situation triggers the
                                            implications of Article 25 of the constitution, which guarantees the equality of citizens before the
                                            law. However, true equality cannot be achieved until these individuals are provided with
                                            equitable opportunities. In conclusion, the overrepresentation of minorities among sanitation
                                            workers is rooted in the lack of proper education as guaranteed by Article 25A. Addressing this
                                            educational disparity is crucial to breaking the cycle that confines these individuals to particular
                                            job sectors and is essential to upholding the constitutional principle of equality</p>
                                            
                                        <p>There have been instances where vacancies for sanitation workers were available, but the
                                            eligibility criteria were limited to minorities of the country. This constitutes a blatant violation of
                                            Article 25, resulting in a division between two classes. The founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali
                                            Jinnah, clearly emphasized the equality of all citizens in his seminal address. However, such
                                            discriminatory practices or classifications only serve to create a rift within the underprivileged
                                            class.</p>
                                            
                                        <p>It's evident that <strong>Article 4(2)(a)</strong> and <strong>Article 9</strong> encapsulate a fundamental human right: the right
                                            to life. Sanitation workers, when exposed to manholes, also expose themselves to hazardous
                                            gases. Due to the presence of organic matter, when oxygen is lacking, it decomposes into
                                            Hydrogen Sulphide, creating a lethal environment within the manhole for these workers.
                                            Unfortunately, in Pakistan, workers enter manholes without proper protective gear, resulting in
                                            severe skin and health issues. Tragically, this sometimes leads to fatalities, thereby infringing
                                            upon the rights enshrined in Article 4(2)(a) and Article 9 and one such incident amidst numerous others 
                                            occurred in 2022, when two sanitary workers lost their lives in DHA Karachi
                                            while performing duties within a manhole. </p>    

                                        <p> It is <strong>pertinent</strong> to note here that the following matter falls to be one of public importance
                                            involving fundamental human rights thus paving way for invocation of article 184(3) of the
                                            Constitution. A matter becomes of public importance when it directly effects the public at large.
                                            The following phrase can be bifurcated into two portions i.e., directly and public at large. The
                                            following situation becomes direct as safety kits are not being provided to sanitary workers by
                                            the government, leading to deaths of sanitary workers. The second element involves “public at
                                            large”, limiting public at large to a specified number of groups would be anomalous but when
                                            one talks about public at large it speaks for a significant portion of the citizenry. Here it leaves
                                            no doubt that sanitation works are undertaken by minorities of the country, that make a
                                            significant and considerable portion of the citizenry. The last element of article 184 (3) requires
                                            there to be involvement of fundamental rights, which have been considered in detail above.</p>

                                        <blockquote>It goes without saying that the jurisprudence developed by our courts have been negligible in the
                                            aspect. Attention could be drawn towards the case Suo Moto Action Regarding Covid-19 (2020
                                            SCMR 1036) where it was emphasized in an “order” merely that rights of sanitary workers be
                                            secured and they be provided with safety kits however, no progress seems to have been made in
                                            this regard. </blockquote>
                                        <p>In <strong>conclusion,</strong>it is important to recognize that solutions can be found for every challenge,
                                            including the one we have discussed. A crucial step is to raise widespread awareness about the
                                            difficulties faced by sanitation workers. Additionally, the government should take the initiative
                                            to compile data on a regional basis concerning these workers. This data can then be utilized to
                                            establish a monthly stipend and extend health benefits to them. Equipping sanitary workers
                                            with necessary items like masks and protective clothing should also be a priority, as it can
                                            significantly reduce health risks. Lastly, ensuring proper training and expertise among those in
                                            this profession is essential. By implementing these measures, we can work towards improving
