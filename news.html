                                <strong>Chief Justice of Supreme Court,<br></strong>
                                <strong>Republic of Pakistan</p></strong>
                                <p><strong>Subject: </strong> Request for enforcing fundamental rights of sanitary workers in Pakistan under article 184(3)
                                    of Constitution of Pakistan,1973
                                    </p>
                                    <p>I, Zarrar Haider Bhatti & Ammar Junaid, hope that this letter finds you in the best of health and high
                                        spirits. I am writing to you with the utmost respect and trust in the wisdom and integrity of the
                                        esteemed office you hold as the Chief Justice of Pakistan.</p>
                                        <p>As a concerned citizen of this nation, I am compelled to highlight an issue that has long been
                                            neglected, one that not only involves the violation of constitutional rights but also underscores the
                                            state's failure to address it adequately. Over the years, sanitary workers in Pakistan have endured
                                            marginalization and discrimination, resulting in a blatant violation of their constitutional rights. The
                                            purpose of this letter is to shed light on the hardships faced by these sanitary workers, which have
                                            led to severe health and psychological issues. The state's historical silence on their rights and its
                                            failure to provide adequate support has prompted me to write this letter. Consequently, I will outline
                                            how the constitutional rights of sanitary workers are being violated, necessitating the invocation of
                                            Article 184(3) of the constitution.</p>
                                    <p>It is essential to highlight that a significant proportion of sanitary workers in Pakistan belong to
                                        minority communities. In a population where 96.5% of people identify as Muslims, and minorities
                                        such as Christians and Hindus make up 1.6% and 1.7% respectively, it is striking that approximately
                                        80% of sanitary workers are from minority backgrounds. This stark contrast raises concerns about
                                        discriminatory and marginalizing policies implemented by the state.<strong>Article 25(1)</strong> of the Constitution
                                        underscores the principle of equality among all citizens. However, this principle becomes illusory
                                        when the state itself, in the allocation of sanitary worker positions, reserves these opportunities
                                        exclusively for non-Muslims. One such situation arose This policy not only perpetuates
                                        discrimination but also contradicts the spirit of equality enshrined in our constitution.
                                        </p> 
                                    <p>The constitutional mandate outlined in <strong>Article 9</strong> establishes the fundamental right to life, which has
                                        evolved into a universally recognized norm in recent times, imposing an unassailable obligation on
                                        the state to safeguard it at all costs. Regrettably, the lives of sanitary workers have been tragically
                                        extinguished due to the state's failure to provide them with the basic equipment essential for
                                        sanitation work and its inadequate provision of rescue services.
                                        </p>
                                    <p>One such heart-wrenching incident serves as a poignant example: the untimely demise of Irfan
                                        Masih from Umer Kot, who was transported to a hospital only to be left unattended by medical
                                        professionals. His tragic fate was sealed as, from the perspective of these doctors, his occupation in
                                        sanitation had rendered him impure. Similarly, in the year 2021, Faisal Masih and Nadeem Masih lost
                                        their lives while valiantly attempting to rescue Michael Maish when rescue services callously refused
                                        to provide assistance to him while he was trapped in a manhole. The perilous nature of manholes, 
                                        characterized by the presence of noxious gases, creates a deadly environment. When the human
                                        body is exposed to these noxious gases, the risk of fatality escalates significantly. Despite this
                                        alarming reality, a substantial number of sanitary workers in Pakistan continue to operate within
                                        manholes without access to rudimentary protective equipment such as jumpsuits, PVC boots, safety
                                        goggles, masks, and safety harnesses. These are fundamental mitigatory measures that must be
                                        rigorously enforced by the state, yet their absence perpetuates a breach of the constitutional
                                        commitment laid forth in Article 9. It is imperative that immediate attention and corrective action be
                                        taken to rectify this situation, ensuring the safety and well-being of sanitary workers who tirelessly
                                        contribute to the cleanliness and hygiene of our communities. Failure to do so not only compound
                                        the violation of their constitutional rights but also diminishes the state's commitment to upholding
                                        the sacred principle of the right to life for all its citizens.</p>
                                    <p>Sanitary workers endure abysmal working conditions that not only expose them to the risk of severe
                                        respiratory diseases, as previously mentioned, but also subject their bodies to the perils of handling
                                        filthy human and industrial waste. This grim reality not only contributes to respiratory ailments but
                                        also inflicts significant skin issues upon these dedicated workers.</p>
                                    <p>Regrettably, in the face of these dire circumstances, there appears to be an absence of a coherent
                                        state policy aimed at effectively safeguarding the rights of sanitary workers. It is imperative to note
                                        that the Supreme Court, in accordance with Article 184(3) of the Constitution, retains the authority
                                        to assume jurisdiction over matters concerning the enforcement of rights enshrined in Chapter 1 of
                                        the Constitution.
                                        </p>
                                    <p>Continuing to remain silent in the face of these challenges would undoubtedly result in a grievous
                                        infringement of the rights of sanitary workers, constituting a direct violation of <strong>Article 184(3).</strong>
                                        Therefore, in light of these compelling circumstances, it is respectfully submitted that the Supreme
                                        Court, in fulfillment of its constitutional duty, exercises its original jurisdiction to champion the
                                        rights of sanitary workers diligently.</p>
                                    <p>With profound respect and best regards, </p> 
                                    <p>Zarrar Haider Bhatti </p>
